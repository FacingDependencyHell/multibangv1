# Multibang v1
A 3D printed cage for the Dum Bum 0.2g firecrackers.
This cage enables you to bundle 5 of the firecrackers into a makeshift multibang. 

The center piece is raised for the purpose of making the fuse shorter, ensuring primary detonation of the center firecracker, which rips the cage and scatters the remaining lit firecrackers.
The cage is designed to desintegrate uppon explosion instead of shrapnelling.

Please be carefull, use common sense.
